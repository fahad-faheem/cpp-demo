// Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations 
// such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder). 
// These operators work with numbers to calculate values. 
// For example, adding two numbers gives their sum, and modulus provides the remainder when one number is divided by another
